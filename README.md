# Dll-Streaming

# A simple encrypted Dll/File streaming.

## How does this work?

This program will "stream" your encrypted dll/file by calling InternetReadFile.
After that itÂ´s being decrypted using a simple blowfish en/decryption algorithm.

## How to use it?

[+] Encryption: 

Change the en/decryption keys to some random characters (like shown).

Drag and drop your dll onto the exe, it will now split the file into 4 encrypted parts. Upload them to your web server. 
 - Done.

[+] Decryption:

Include Stream.h and Stream.cpp in your project.

Replace the example urls with your uploaded file urls.

To stream the file simply call GetFile(). (Like shown and explained in main.cpp)

This source is based on the GH streaming, so credits to them.

I decided to make this a little better a few years ago. Please keep in mind that this is far away of being anywhere secure.
